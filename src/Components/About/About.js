      <h1>Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction</h1>
      <p>
        Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between two variables
        by fitting a linear equation to observed data. In the context of house price prediction,
        linear regression can be used to model the relationship between various features of a house
        (such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage) and its price.
      </p>

      <h2>How Linear Regression Works:</h2>
      <p>
        The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the
        output (house price). The model learns the coefficients for each feature to minimize the
        difference between the predicted values and the actual prices in the training data.
      </p>

      <h2>Application in House Price Prediction:</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of predicting house prices, a linear regression model can take input features
        like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and other relevant factors to
        estimate the price of a house. This is useful for real estate professionals, homebuyers, and
        sellers to get an idea of a property's value based on its characteristics.
      </p>

      <h2>Building a House Price Prediction Model:</h2>
      <p>
        To build a house price prediction model, you need a dataset with historical information about
        houses and their prices. The model is trained on this data to learn the relationships
        between features and prices. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions for new
        houses.
      </p>

      <h2>React Component for Predictions:</h2>
      <p>
        You can create a React component that takes input for house features, sends a request to a
        backend server (built with Django, for example), and displays the predicted house price.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind that this is a simplified overview, and building a robust house price prediction
        system involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and integration with a
        backend for serving predictions.
